Q3. Long vs Short Positions Tracker

Problem:
Youâ€™re holding both long and short positions. Mark which are long (positive qty) and which are short (negative qty).
positions = {
    "AAPL": 100,
    "TSLA": -50,
    "NFLX": 0,
    "GOOG": 20
}

Goal: Print whether each stock is LONG / SHORT / NEUTRAL.
Learn: Conditional logic, understanding hedge fund bets.
