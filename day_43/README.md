# 🐍 Day 43/300 – Threads Logic Systems in Python

Today, I built the **core logic behind Threads (Meta’s Twitter-like platform)** — from post character limits to trending hashtag tracking and spam detection.

It felt like breaking down Threads into **backend logic modules**, simulating how the platform works under the hood with simple Python scripts.

This day was **tough and challenging** — some parts required careful thinking about data structures and logic flow. I even took the help of **Claude** to break down tricky parts and brainstorm approaches.

## 🔍 What I Solved Today

1. **Post Character Counter**  
   → Counted characters in a post and checked if it exceeded the 500-character limit.

2. **Hashtag Extractor**  
   → Extracted all hashtags from a post into a list.

3. **Mention Detector**  
   → Detected all usernames mentioned with `@` in a post.

4. **Post Feed Sorter**  
   → Sorted posts from most recent to oldest using timestamps.

5. **Trending Hashtags Counter**  
   → Counted occurrences of each hashtag across posts and returned the top trending ones.

6. **Like Counter**  
   → Calculated total likes and identified the post with the highest likes.

7. **Post Search**  
   → Returned all posts containing a given keyword.

8. **Follow Suggestions**  
   → Suggested new accounts to follow based on friends-of-friends logic.

9. **Spam Detector**  
   → Checked if a post contained blocked or spam words and flagged it.

10. **Engagement Score Calculator**  
    → Calculated an engagement score based on likes, comments, and reposts.

## 💭 Daily Reflection

Today pushed my **logic-building skills** — social media backend logic is not as simple as it looks.  
From parsing strings to designing sorting and recommendation systems, every feature was a small but essential building block.

By simulating Threads in Python, I’m thinking like a **social platform engineer**, understanding the invisible systems that drive user experience.

Tomorrow? More complex systems.  
Because **“Difficult problems are the ones worth solving.”**

## 🧠 Sample – Hashtag Extractor

```python
def extract_hashtags(post):
    return [word for word in post.split() if word.startswith("#")]

# Example:
post = "Loving #Python and #AI"
print(extract_hashtags(post))
# Output: ['#Python', '#AI']
```
