Q1. Phonebook Lookup (With Error Handling)
Task: Write a program that stores names and phone numbers in a dictionary.
Let the user input a name, and return the number.
If name doesnâ€™t exist, print: "Contact not found." using try-except.

Test input like:
contacts = {"Alice": "9123456789", "Bob": "9000000000"}
Goal: Handle KeyError when a name is not found.
