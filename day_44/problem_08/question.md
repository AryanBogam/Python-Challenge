Q8. Azure Deployment Status Tracker
Task: Simulate deployment progress by printing "Deploying..." until reaching 100%, then "Deployment complete".
Example Output:
Deploying... 20%
Deploying... 40%
Deploying... 60%
Deploying... 80%
Deployment complete
Why: Azure shows progress updates during resource creation.
