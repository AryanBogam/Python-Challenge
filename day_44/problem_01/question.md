Q1. Azure Storage Blob Name Checker
Task: Given a file name, check if it follows Azure blob naming rules (only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, must start and end with a letter or number).
Example Input: "my-file-1"
Example Output: "Valid blob name"
Why: Azure blob names have specific rules â€” this simulates that validation.
