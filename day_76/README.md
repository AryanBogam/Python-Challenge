# 🐍 Day 76/300 – Café Management System in Python ☕🍕🍔  

Today, I built a **mini Café Management System** – a simple but practical project to handle basic order-taking and billing for a restaurant.  
This project focused on **dictionaries, conditionals, and user input handling** in Python.

## ✅ Features Implemented  

- 📋 **Menu System** → Defined a menu using Python dictionaries with items and prices.  
- 🙋 **User Order Input** → Allowed users to order one or more items interactively.  
- ➕ **Order Total Calculation** → Added up the prices of ordered items.  
- 🚫 **Invalid Item Handling** → Displayed a message if the ordered item is not on the menu.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

This project was a fun way to practice **dictionaries** and **if-else logic**:  
- Learned how to store menu data in a simple, reusable format.  
- Got comfortable checking if user input exists in a dictionary.  
- Understood how to update totals dynamically.
