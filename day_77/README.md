# 🐍 Day 77/300 – Rock Paper Scissors Mini Project in Python 🎮  

Today, I built a **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** – a simple but classic project to practice **conditional logic** and **randomization** in Python.  
This project focused on **user input handling, computer-generated choices, and outcome evaluation**.

## ✅ Features Implemented  

- 🎲 **Random Computer Choice** → Used `random.choice()` to generate computer’s move.  
- 🎮 **User Input** → Took player’s move (`Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissor`) via `input()`.  
- 🔄 **Match Logic** → Compared user’s choice with computer’s choice to decide the result.  
- 🏆 **Result Display** → Printed whether it’s a **Win, Lose, or Tie**.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today was all about applying **conditional statements** in a real-world mini project:  
- Practiced **user input validation** and learned how to compare choices safely.  
- Understood the **game flow** – input → computer choice → comparison → output.  
- This was fun because it felt like building my own small game for the first time!
