Question 6: Altitude Clearance Checker
Problem:
An aircraft must fly above a certain altitude to clear a mountain.
You’ll ask the user to enter:
Aircraft’s current altitude in feet
Required minimum altitude

Then, tell them:

“Clear for flight.” if current ≥ minimum

“Increase altitude!” if current < minimum
