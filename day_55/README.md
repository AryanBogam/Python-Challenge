# 🐍 Day 55/300 – Functions & Loops: Intermediate to Advanced Python Problems  

Today, I explored **Python functions and loops** — from factorial calculators and Fibonacci series generators to prime factorization and matrix operations.  

It felt like simulating **core programming concepts behind data analytics, algorithmic challenges, and automation tasks**, showing how Python powers **logic building, problem-solving, and structured coding**.  

This day was **fun, intermediate-to-advanced level, and logical** — these problems strengthen the **foundations needed for real-world coding challenges**.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today’s challenge helped me **master loops, functions, and logic building** in Python.  
From **mathematical operations to string analytics**, these problems made me think like a **problem solver** rather than just a coder.  

By solving these exercises, I realized how **small reusable functions** can power **bigger automation and data processing systems**.  

Tomorrow? Moving toward **data structures + real-world APIs** where Python starts solving **larger-scale challenges**.  
Because **“Logic is the foundation of every powerful application.”**

## 🧠 Sample – Factorial Calculator  

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(factorial(5))
# Output: 120
