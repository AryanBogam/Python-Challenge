Q1. Post Reactions Beyond Likes

Extend the like system to multiple reactions:
Reactions: Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry.
Each user can react only once per post but can change the reaction.
Store as post["reactions"] = {"Like": 3, "Love": 1, ...}

This simulates Facebookâ€™s rich engagement model.
