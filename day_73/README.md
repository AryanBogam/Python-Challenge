# 🐍 Day 73/300 – Mini-Facebook Enhanced Social Features in Python  

Today, I continued expanding the **mini-Facebook project** by adding **enhanced social features, analytics, and personalization**.  
These challenges focused on **advanced user interaction, engagement tracking, and real-world social network functionalities**.

## ✅ Features Implemented  

- 👍 **Post Reactions Beyond Likes** → Multiple reactions: Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry  
- 💬 **Comment Replies (Nested Comments)** → Threaded replies inside comments  
- 🔗 **Post Sharing System** → Share posts, track shares, notify original author  
- 📝 **User Activity Log** → Maintain log of actions: login, posts, comments, reactions  
- 📌 **Pinned Posts** → Pin posts at the top of profiles or groups  
- 🏅 **User Badges / Achievements** → Gamification: reward milestones like likes, comments  
- 🔍 **Search Posts by Keywords** → Search inside posts with optional filters  
- 👑 **Group Roles & Permissions** → Admin, Moderator, Member with access control  
- ⏰ **Post Scheduling System** → Schedule posts for future publishing  
- 📊 **Profile & Group Analytics Dashboard** → Overview of posts, reactions, friends, groups

## 🔍 What I Solved Today  

1. **Post Reactions Beyond Likes**  
   → Extended the reaction system with multiple types. Users can react only once per post but can change reactions.  

2. **Comment Replies (Nested Comments)**  
   → Enabled threaded replies inside comments, stored in a tree-like structure.  

3. **Post Sharing System**  
   → Users can share others’ posts, increment share count, and notify the original author.  

4. **User Activity Log**  
   → Maintained a log of user actions like login/logout, posting, commenting, and reacting.  

5. **Pinned Posts for Profiles or Groups**  
   → Allowed users or admins to pin posts, storing them separately for priority display.  

6. **User Badges / Achievements**  
   → Awarded badges based on milestones such as number of likes, comments, or shares.  

7. **Search Posts by Keywords**  
   → Implemented text search inside posts with optional author/date filters.  

8. **Group Roles & Permissions**  
   → Introduced roles: Admin, Moderator, Member with restricted actions based on role.  

9. **Post Scheduling System**  
   → Users can schedule posts for future times, teaching time-based logic and automation.  

10. **Profile & Group Analytics Dashboard**  
    → Built a dashboard summarizing posts, reactions, comments, friends, and group activity.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today’s focus was on making the mini-Facebook **more dynamic, interactive, and socially intelligent**:  
- Learned about **engagement tracking** and **content prioritization**.  
- Gamification (badges) and analytics introduced me to real-world app insights.  
- Scheduling, role-based permissions, and nested comments brought the platform closer to production-level systems.  

Highlights for me today:  
- **Nested Comments & Replies** → Mastered recursion for real-world threaded data.  
- **Post Reactions & Sharing** → Simulated social engagement like a professional social network.  
- **Activity Logs & Analytics** → Learned aggregation, counting, and dashboard presentation.  

This project also marked **my first attempt at video coding**: I experimented with AI-generated answers to practice coding in a real-world scenario.

## 🧠 Sample – Post Reactions in Python  

```python
posts = {
    1: {"author": "aryan", "content": "Hello World!", "reactions": {}}
}

def react_post(post_id, user, reaction):
    post = posts.get(post_id)
    if not post:
        return "❌ Post not found."
    # Remove previous reaction by user if exists
    for r in post["reactions"]:
        if user in post["reactions"][r]:
            post["reactions"][r].remove(user)
    # Add new reaction
    post["reactions"].setdefault(reaction, []).append(user)
    return f"✅ {user} reacted with {reaction}!"

# Example
print(react_post(1, "aryan", "Love"))
print(react_post(1, "raj", "Haha"))
print(posts)
