# 🔁 Day 26/300 – Intermediate Loops Mastery in Python

Today was all about leveling up my **loop control, iteration flow, and problem-solving techniques**.  
No beginner basics — this was real CS50P-style training with thoughtful, tricky logic challenges.

## ✅ Topics Practiced

- 🌀 Intermediate `for` and `while` loop mastery  
- 🧠 Using `break`, `continue` for control flow  
- 🔁 Nested loops  
- 🎯 Input validation inside loops  
- 🔄 Real-world simulation with loop logic  
- 📚 String and list operations in looping context

1. **Odd Pyramid Builder**  

2. **Inventory Tracker**  

3. **Perfect Number Detector**  

4. **Traffic Light Timer**  

5. **Break the Chain**  

6. **Continue Cleanser**  

7. **Longest Word Finder**  

8. **Palindrome Checker Loop**

## 💭 Daily Reflection

**Today taught me:**  
🔁 Loops aren't just repetition — they're power.  
They simulate traffic lights, detect lucky draws, validate passwords, and more.  
Every loop I wrote improved my logic clarity and real-world thinking.

### Lessons:
- `break` stops chaos.  
- `continue` filters noise.  
- Nesting = power with discipline.  
- Carefully structured loops make programs **intelligent**.

> 🔥 Some of these took serious thinking — I had to **struggle, retry, and even consult Claude** at one point.  
> But I didn’t give up. **I solved each with my own hands.**

## 🔧 Sample – Lucky Draw Simulator

```python
import random

while True:
    number = random.randint(1000, 9999)
    print("Generated:", number)
    if str(number).endswith("777"):
        print("🎉 Lucky number found:", number)
        break
