# 🧠 Day 8 – Python For Loop Mastery 🔁

✅ **Topics Covered**
- `for` loops with `range()`
- Iterating over lists, strings, numbers
- Conditional logic inside loops
- Accumulators for sum, factorial, max
- Reversing sequences
- Pattern printing (visual logic)
- Manual data processing without built-ins

---

## 🚀 What I Built Today

I solved 10 structured problems using `for` loops, including:

- ✅ Number printing and summation
- ✅ Multiplication table generator
- ✅ Star pattern builder
- ✅ Prime number checker
- ✅ Manual max finder
- ✅ Vowel extractor
- ✅ Reverse list logic
- ✅ Factorial calculator

Each problem trained my **loop structuring, logic flow, and clean iteration control** — all foundational to automation, backend logic, and real-time data processing in AI systems.

## 🧪 Sample Code – Star Pattern Builder ✨

```python
rows = int(input("Enter rows: "))
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    print("*" * i)
