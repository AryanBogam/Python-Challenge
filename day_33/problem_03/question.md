Q3. Train Route Finder
Concept: List traversal + condition matching
Problem:
Given a list of stations in order, write a function is_direct_route(start, end, route) that checks if you can travel directly from start to end in that sequence.
route = ["Mumbai", "Pune", "Solapur", "Hyderabad", "Chennai"]
is_direct_route("Mumbai", "Chennai", route) → True
is_direct_route("Hyderabad", "Pune", route) → False
