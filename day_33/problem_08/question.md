Q8. Platform Assignment System

Concept: REPL + mapping logic
Problem:
Simulate platform assignment using:
train_to_platform = {
  "12903": 1,
  "12050": 2
}

Create a function assign_platform(train_no, platform_no):
If already assigned → warn user
Else → assign and confirm

Add print statements like: "Platform 3 assigned to Train 22120"
