Q10. Railway Announcement Generator

Concept: String formatting + dynamic input
Problem:
Create a function generate_announcement(train_no, station, platform, delay=0) that prints:

Without delay:
"Train 12903 is arriving at Mumbai on platform 5."

With delay:
"Train 12903 is delayed by 10 minutes and will arrive at Mumbai on platform 5."
