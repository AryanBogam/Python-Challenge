Today, I solved the **CamelCase problem** from **Harvard's CS50P Week 2**!  
This problem focused on **string manipulation** and **converting naming conventions** between camelCase and snake_case.

## ✅ Problem Overview  

- 🐍 **String Conversion** → Transform camelCase to snake_case format.  
- 🔄 **Character Iteration** → Loop through each character in the string.  
- 📝 **Case Detection** → Identify uppercase letters as word boundaries.  
- 🔧 **String Building** → Construct new string with underscores and lowercase.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### CamelCase to Snake_Case Converter
Built a program that:
- Prompts user for a camelCase variable name
- Iterates through each character
- Detects uppercase letters as new word starts
- Converts uppercase to lowercase and adds underscore prefix
- Outputs the snake_case equivalent

**Example**:
```
camelCase: name
snake_case: name

camelCase: firstName
snake_case: first_name

camelCase: preferredFirstName
snake_case: preferred_first_name

camelCase: XMLHttpRequest
snake_case: _x_m_l_http_request
```

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

This problem was a great introduction to **string iteration and character-by-character processing**.  
It taught me how programming conventions can be transformed algorithmically with simple logic.
