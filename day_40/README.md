# 🎥 Day 40/300 – Twitch Logic Systems in Python

Today, I built the **core logic behind Twitch’s main features** — from tracking viewer counts and follower goals to managing VIP lists and detecting top donors.

It felt like breaking down Twitch into **backend logic modules**, simulating how the platform works under the hood with simple Python scripts.

## 🔍 What I Solved Today

1. **Viewer Count Tracker**  
   → Found the highest viewer count during the stream

2. **Live Stream Status Checker**  
   → Printed `"Stream is LIVE!"` or `"Stream is offline"` based on a boolean

3. **Follower Goal Progress**  
   → Checked if the goal was reached or how many followers were left

4. **Chat Message Filter**  
   → Returned only messages containing `"hype"`

5. **Stream Category Switcher**  
   → Displayed a message when the stream category changed

6. **Subscriber Counter**  
   → Summed total subscribers from multiple days

7. **Emote Usage Tracker**  
   → Counted how many times a specific emote appeared in chat

8. **Stream Length Calculator**  
   → Calculated the total stream duration in hours

9. **Top Donor Finder**  
   → Found the user who donated the highest amount

10. **VIP List Checker**  
    → Checked if a user was in the VIP list and printed a message

## 💭 Daily Reflection

Today showed me how **streaming platforms thrive on small but powerful logic systems**.  
Each feature — from live status to donor tracking — is just a function doing its job well.  

By simulating Twitch in Python, I’m sharpening my skills to think like a **backend engineer** who can build systems that run in real-time for millions of users.  

Tomorrow? More building.  
Because **fame might fade — but systems last forever.**

## 🧠 Sample – Viewer Count Tracker

```python
def highest_viewer_count(viewers):
    return max(viewers)

# Example:
viewers_per_hour = [120, 150, 180, 160]
print("Highest viewers:", highest_viewer_count(viewers_per_hour))
# Output: Highest viewers: 180
