Q2. Label Filter
Task: Given a list of emails with labels, return only those matching a given label.
Example:
emails = [{"subject": "Invoice", "label": "Work"}, {"subject": "Party", "label": "Personal"}]
label = "Work"
Output: [{"subject": "Invoice", "label": "Work"}]
Why: Gmail filters emails under categories (Work, Promotions, etc.).
