Snap Streak Checker
Track daily activity streaks.

Problem:
Write a function check_streak(days) that takes the number of consecutive days two friends have snapped each other, and returns:
If days >= 3: "Streak Active!"
If days == 0: "Streak Lost"
Else: "Keep Snapping!"

Input: check_streak(5)
Output: "Streak Active!"
