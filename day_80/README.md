# 🐍 Day 80/300 – Contact Book App in Python 📱  

Today, I built a **Contact Book Application** – a comprehensive contact management system to practice **nested dictionaries**, **string operations**, and **advanced menu handling** in Python.  
This project focused on **complex data structures, search functionality, and real-world application development**.

## ✅ Features Implemented  

- 👤 **Create Contacts** → Store name, age, email, and mobile with duplicate prevention.  
- 👁️ **View Contacts** → Display individual contact details by name.  
- ✏️ **Update Contacts** → Modify existing contact information with validation.  
- 🗑️ **Delete Contacts** → Remove contacts from the system safely.  
- 🔍 **Search Contacts** → Find contacts using partial name matching.  
- 📊 **Count Contacts** → Display total number of stored contacts.  
- 🚪 **Exit System** → Clean program termination with goodbye message.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today was about building a **feature-rich application** with advanced functionality:  
- Mastered **nested dictionaries** – storing multiple contact details per person.  
- Implemented **search algorithms** – case-insensitive partial string matching.  
- Enhanced **user validation** – preventing duplicates and handling missing contacts.  
- Built **professional UX** – clear feedback messages and intuitive navigation.  
- This felt like creating a mini contact manager that could replace a phone's contact app!
