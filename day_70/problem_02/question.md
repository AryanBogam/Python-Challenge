Q2. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal (Leetcode 103)

Problem: Traverse a binary tree level by level, but alternate directions (left→right, right→left).
Why: Uses BFS + queue + reversal trick. Good practice for tree traversal variations.
Hint: Keep a flag that flips each level to reverse order.
