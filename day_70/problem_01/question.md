Q1. Word Search (Leetcode 79) â€“ Backtracking in 2D Grid

Problem: Given a 2D board of characters and a word, check if the word exists in the grid. You can move horizontally or vertically.
Why: Combines DFS recursion + backtracking. Forces you to think about visited states in a matrix.
Hint: For each cell, try DFS; mark as visited; unmark when backtracking.
