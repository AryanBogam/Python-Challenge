## 💡 Learning Reflection

This day wasn’t easy.

Some problems were frustrating. I got stuck, doubted myself, and at times even gave up for a while.
But I reminded myself why I started — and came back with more focus.

To grow faster and think like a real developer, I used ChatGPT to:

- Understand the **logic and structure** of each problem  
- Sharpen my **thinking, debugging, and validation skills**  
- Break complex tasks into **clear, manageable steps**  
- Think like someone building systems — not just solving assignments  

🎯 I didn’t blindly copy anything. I used ChatGPT as a guide to **learn the logic**, then wrote and refined the code **on my own**.

This was one of those days that taught me:  
**“You don’t win because it’s easy. You win because you don’t quit.”**

## 🧪 Sample Code – Secure Username Validator  
```python
def verify_username(username):
    if len(username) < 5:
        return "Username too short"
    if not username[0].isalpha():
        return "Must start with a letter"
    if not all(c.isalnum() or c == "_" for c in username):
        return "Only letters, digits and _ allowed"
    return "Username is valid"
