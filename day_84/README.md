Today, I solved the **Expressions problem** from **Harvard's CS50P Week 1**!  
This problem focused on **parsing user input** and performing **mathematical operations** with proper formatting.

## âœ… Problem Overview  

- ðŸ”¢ **Math Expression Evaluator** â†’ Parse "x y z" format and calculate result.  
- ðŸ§® **Basic Arithmetic** â†’ Handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.  
- ðŸ“Š **Formatted Output** â†’ Display result as a floating-point number with one decimal place.  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Input Parsing** â†’ Split user input and convert strings to integers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

### Math Interpreter
Built a calculator that:
- Prompts user for expression in format: `x y z` (e.g., "1 + 1")
- Parses the input to extract numbers and operator
- Performs the calculation
- Outputs result formatted to 1 decimal place

**Example**:
```
Expression: 1 + 1
2.0

Expression: 2 - 3  
-1.0

Expression: 2 * 2
4.0

Expression: 50 / 5
10.0
```

## ðŸ’­ Daily Reflection  

This problem was a great introduction to **string parsing and mathematical operations**.  
It reinforced the importance of **clean input handling** and **proper output formatting** in Python.
