## üîç What I Solved Today  

1. **Video Categories / Tags**  
   ‚Üí Added a `tags` list to videos and allowed searching videos by tag.  

2. **Top Liked Videos**  
   ‚Üí Sorted videos by number of likes and displayed the top ones.  

3. **Dislike Percentage**  
   ‚Üí Calculated dislikes as a percentage of total reactions for each video.  

4. **Comment Likes**  
   ‚Üí Enabled liking/unliking individual comments, stored in a `likes` list.  

5. **User Profile Summary**  
   ‚Üí Aggregated a user‚Äôs total videos, views, comments, and likes for a quick overview.  

6. **Video Description Field**  
   ‚Üí Added a description key and allowed editing the content of a video.  

7. **Remove Video / Delete**  
   ‚Üí Allowed only the author to delete a video and updated related references safely.  

8. **Recently Watched**  
   ‚Üí Displayed the last N videos watched by a user in reverse chronological order.  

9. **Search Channels by Name**  
   ‚Üí Filtered videos or channels by author name to allow easy discovery.

## üí≠ Daily Reflection  

Today‚Äôs focus was on making the mini-YouTube **more interactive and analytical**:  
- Learned how to handle **nested dictionaries and lists** for comments, likes, and tags.  
- Practiced **sorting, filtering, and aggregation** for meaningful insights.  
- Enhanced personalization features like recently watched videos, top liked videos, and user activity summaries.  

Highlights for me today:  
- **Top Liked Videos & Dislike Percentage** ‚Üí Introduced basic content metrics.  
- **Comment Likes** ‚Üí Learned to manage nested user interactions.  
- **User Profile Summary & Most Active User** ‚Üí Gave a glimpse of real-world analytics dashboards.  

This day felt **rewarding**, combining multiple small features into a realistic, modular project.  
> ‚ÄúSmall consistent steps today lead to big products tomorrow.‚Äù ‚ö°

## üß† Sample ‚Äì Video Categories & Top Liked in Python  

```python
videos = []

def upload_video(title, author, tags=[]):
    video_id = len(videos) + 1
    videos.append({
        "id": video_id,
        "title": title,
        "author": author,
        "views": 0,
        "likes": [],
        "dislikes": [],
        "comments": [],
        "tags": tags,
        "description": ""
    })
    return f"‚úÖ Video '{title}' uploaded with ID {video_id}!"

def top_liked_videos(top_n=3):
    sorted_videos = sorted(videos, key=lambda v: len(v["likes"]), reverse=True)
    return sorted_videos[:top_n]

# Example
print(upload_video("Python Tutorial", "Aryan", tags=["Education", "Python"]))
print(upload_video("Vlog Day 1", "Raj", tags=["Vlog"]))
videos[0]["likes"].extend(["Aryan", "Raj"])
print(top_liked_videos())
print(videos)
