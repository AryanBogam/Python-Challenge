# 🔁 Day 23 – Python Revision & Core Logic Strengthening 🧠

✅ **Topics Revisited**
- Tuples (immutability, safe data logging)  
- Sets (commonality, uniqueness, filtering)  
- Dictionaries (key-value logic, merging, frequency analysis)  
- Nested data structures  
- Loops with conditions  
- Real-world tracking and data transformation tasks

## 🔄 What I Solved Today

Today was all about **repetition for mastery** — revisiting foundational concepts and applying them to practical use-cases. Solved **10+ challenges** based on real-life systems and logic:

1. **Student Score Tracker – Immutable Logs**  
2. **Immutable Month Planner**  
3. **List to Tuple Converter**  
4. **Common Interests Finder (Set Operations)**  
5. **Network Security Challenge (IP Logic)**  
6. **Frequency Counter**  
7. **Student Pass/Fail Reporter**  
8. **Dictionary Key-Value Swapper**  
9. **Merge Student Marks with Averaging**  
10. **Course Enrollment Tracker**

## 💬 Daily Reflection

For the next 3 days, I’m focused on **repeating questions from the past 22 days** to:
- Sharpen logic  
- Strengthen concepts  
- Cement the fundamentals  

Today’s tasks reminded me:  
👉 Simplicity is power.  
👉 Tuples protect your data.  
👉 Sets are perfect for filtering truth.  
👉 Dictionaries are the foundation of fast, readable systems.  
👉 And Python? It’s only magic when you build the logic yourself.

## 🔍 Sample – Network Security Challenge

```python
allowed = {"192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.20", "10.0.0.5"}
blocked = {"192.168.1.15", "10.0.0.10", "192.168.1.20"}
requests = {"192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.15", "192.168.1.20", "10.0.0.5", "203.0.113.1"}

accepted = requests & allowed
rejected = requests & blocked
unknown = requests - allowed - blocked

print("Accepted:", accepted)
print("Blocked:", rejected)
print("Unknown:", unknown)
