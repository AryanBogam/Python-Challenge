Q10. Course Enrollment Tracker
Scenario:
Youâ€™re building a system to track students and the courses they are enrolled in. A student can be enrolled in multiple courses.

Your Task:
Create a dictionary where:
Key = Student's name (string)
Value = List of courses they are enrolled in (list of strings)

Example:
{
  "Aryan": ["Python", "Math", "AI"],
  "Riya": ["Math", "Physics"],
  "Om": ["Python"]
}

Then do the following:
Print all students and their courses in a readable format.
Ask the user for a course name and print all students enrolled in that course.
