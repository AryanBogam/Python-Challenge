# 🐍 Day 48/300 – PowerPoint Logic Systems in Python

Today, I built the **core logic behind PowerPoint-like features** — from counting slides and validating titles to detecting duplicates, searching keywords, and estimating presentation length.  

It felt like simulating **PowerPoint’s internal slide operations** in Python, breaking down how the platform handles presentations, consistency checks, and user experience.  

This day was **practical, realistic, and beginner-friendly** — these are the same kinds of logical checks used by real-world presentation software.

## 🔍 What I Solved Today

1. **Slide Counter**  
   → Counted how many slides were in a presentation.  

2. **Title Validator**  
   → Checked whether each slide had a title or not.  

3. **Duplicate Slide Detector**  
   → Found duplicate slide titles.  

4. **Bullet Point Counter**  
   → Counted how many bullet points a slide had.  

5. **Slide Reorder Simulator**  
   → Swapped the order of two slides.  

6. **Theme Checker**  
   → Verified if all slides used the same theme.  

7. **Word Counter in Slide**  
   → Counted total words inside a slide.  

8. **Empty Slide Detector**  
   → Detected slides with no content.  

9. **Slide Search**  
   → Searched for a keyword across all slides.  

10. **Presentation Length Estimator**  
    → Estimated total presentation time based on slide count.

## 💭 Daily Reflection

Today’s challenge gave me a **clear understanding of how presentation tools manage slides and maintain consistency**.  
PowerPoint isn’t just about showing text — it’s **a system of validations, searches, and formatting rules** that make presentations smooth and professional.  

By simulating these rules in Python, I’m starting to think like a **software engineer building productivity tools**, focusing on **organization, usability, and user experience**.  

Tomorrow? Taking on **bigger platform-like systems**.  
Because **“Every big product starts with small scripts.”**

## 🧠 Sample – Slide Counter

```python
def slide_counter(slides):
    return len(slides)

# Example:
slides = ["Intro", "Agenda", "Conclusion"]
print(slide_counter(slides))
# Output: 3
