Today, I completed **Harvard's CS50P Week 1 (Conditionals)**!  
I solved **all the problem sets** including the extension challenges — diving deep into conditional logic and decision-making in Python.

## ✅ Topics Covered  

- 🔄 **If/Elif/Else Statements** → Mastered conditional logic flow.  
- 🧠 **Boolean Logic** → Understanding True/False evaluations.  
- 🔍 **String Comparisons** → Case-sensitive vs case-insensitive matching.  
- 🎯 **Edge Case Handling** → Accounting for different input formats.  
- 📝 **CS50P Problem Sets** → Solved Deep Thought, Home Federal Savings Bank, and File Extensions.

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### Deep Thought
Built a program recognizing "42" in multiple formats (numeric, spelled out, different cases).

### Home Federal Savings Bank  
Created a greeting evaluator that assigns monetary values based on politeness levels.

### File Extensions
Developed a file type detector that maps extensions to proper MIME types.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Week 1 was all about **making decisions in code** — teaching programs how to think and respond intelligently.  
The problems were deceptively simple but required careful attention to **string handling and logical conditions**.
