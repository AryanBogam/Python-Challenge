Question 10: App Feature Usage Tracker – Product Analytics

Scenario:
You’re tracking which users use which app features in your SaaS product.

used_dark_mode = {"Aryan", "Om", "Tina", "Riya"}
used_voice_commands = {"Tina", "Riya", "Sahil"}
used_notifications = {"Aryan", "Om", "Meera", "Sahil"}

Determine:

Users who used all three features
Users who used exactly two features
Users who used only one feature

Expected Logic:

Use intersection of all 3 sets
Use symmetric difference + careful logic to count exactly 2
Use subtraction or count logic to filter those in only one
