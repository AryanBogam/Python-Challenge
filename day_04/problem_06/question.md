Question 6: Online Course Checker â€“ Who Completed What?

Scenario: For your EdTech platform, you have these sets:

Students who completed Python: {"Aryan", "Riya", "Om", "Tina"}
Students who completed AI: {"Riya", "Tina", "Sahil"}
All registered students: {"Aryan", "Riya", "Om", "Tina", "Sahil", "Meera"}

Determine:
Who completed both Python and AI?
Who completed only one course?
Who completed none?

Expected Logic:
Use &, ^, and difference()
Think like a course analytics dashboard
