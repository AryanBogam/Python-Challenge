## ðŸš€ What I Built Today

I solved real-world challenges involving data filtering, access control, product analytics, fraud detection, and customer behavior using Python sets.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Code Snippet â€“ Fraud Detection Logic

```python
verified_txns = {"TXN101", "TXN102", "TXN103", "TXN104"}
reported_fraud = {"TXN103", "TXN105", "TXN106"}
incoming_txns = {"TXN101", "TXN103", "TXN105", "TXN107"}

clean_txns = incoming_txns & (verified_txns - reported_fraud)
fraudulent_txns = incoming_txns & reported_fraud
suspicious_txns = incoming_txns - (verified_txns | reported_fraud)

print("Clean:", clean_txns)
print("Fraud:", fraudulent_txns)
print("Unknown:", suspicious_txns)
