Question 2: Common Interests Finder
Question: Three friends have different hobbies:

Alice: {"reading", "swimming", "coding", "music"}
Bob: {"gaming", "coding", "music", "dancing"}
Charlie: {"reading", "gaming", "cooking", "music"}

Find: 
1 What hobbies do ALL three friends share? 
2 What hobbies does only Alice have? 
3 What hobbies do Alice and Bob share but Charlie doesn't?

Expected Logic:

Use difference for unique hobbies
Chain multiple set operations
