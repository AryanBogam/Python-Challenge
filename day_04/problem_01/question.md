Question 1: Duplicate Detective
Question: You have a list of student IDs: [101, 102, 103, 101, 104, 102, 105]. Find all duplicate 
IDs and create a set of unique IDs. Then determine how many students were counted multiple times.
Expected Logic:

Use sets to find duplicates
Calculate the difference between original and unique counts
Think about set operations vs list operations
