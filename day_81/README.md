## ✅ Topics Covered  

- 🖥️ **Hello, World!** → Writing the first Python program.  
- 🧠 **Functions & Variables** → Understanding inputs, outputs, and memory usage.  
- 🔄 **Conditionals** → Practiced if/else statements with real problems.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today felt like going **back to the roots** — making sure my Python fundamentals are rock-solid before going deeper.  
Even though I already knew some of these concepts, solving CS50P problems gave me **new ways to think about clean code and best practices**.
