Q3. Rotting Oranges (Medium)

Problem: A grid has:
0 = empty, 1 = fresh orange, 2 = rotten orange.
Each minute, rotten spreads to adjacent fresh.
Find minutes until all rot, or -1 if impossible.
Concepts: BFS in Grid, Queue Simulation.

Why: Classic real-world contagion spread modeling.
Hint: Multi-source BFS from all rotten oranges initially.
