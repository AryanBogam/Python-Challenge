Q2. Word Ladder (Medium)

Problem: Given a start word, end word, and dictionary, find the minimum steps to transform start â†’ end by changing one letter at a time (each new word must exist in dictionary).
Concepts: Graph BFS, String transformations.
Why: Teaches graph traversal in disguise.
Hint: Each word is a node, edges exist if words differ by 1 character.
