- 🤝 **Mutual Friends Finder** → Find overlapping friends between two users  
- 🏷️ **User Tagging** → Mention friends inside posts & notify them  
- 📅 **Events System** → Create events, RSVP (Join/Interested), and manage participation  
- 🟢 **User Status** → Track online/offline activity

## 🔍 What I Solved Today  

1. **Password Reset System**  
   → Added email verification before allowing a password change. Strengthened user account security.  

2. **Post Deletion & Editing**  
   → Allowed only authors to edit/delete their posts. Added `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.  

3. **Post Privacy Settings**  
   → Implemented three levels of visibility: public, friends-only, and private.  

4. **Trending Posts**  
   → Built a ranking system that sorts posts based on likes, comments, and recency.  

5. **Mutual Friends Finder**  
   → Given two users, computed their mutual friends using set operations.  

6. **Tagging Users in Posts**  
   → Enabled tagging like “Had lunch with @Raj” and notified tagged users.  

7. **Event Creation & Participation**  
   → Users can create events and others can RSVP. Simulated community-building features.  

8. **User Status (Online/Offline)**  
   → Tracked whether users are currently online, similar to Messenger’s green dot.  

9. **Save & Bookmark Posts**  
   → Let users save posts for later under `saved_posts`. Added retrieval system.  

10. **Friend Suggestions (People You May Know)**  
    → Suggested new friends based on mutuals, groups, or random picks.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

This day was about making the app feel **closer to a real social network**:  
- Security (password reset) and privacy (post visibility) were major highlights.  
- Realized that **user experience = personalization + control**.  
- Mutual friends and friend suggestions reminded me that **graphs are at the heart of social media**.  

Highlights for me today:  
- **Trending Posts** → Sorting by popularity gave me insights into recommendation systems.  
- **Events** → Helped me see how platforms extend beyond communication into real-world coordination.  
- **Tagging** → Showed how small features boost engagement massively.  

This felt like moving from **basic CRUD** apps to a **socially intelligent platform**.

## 🧠 Sample – Password Reset in Python  

```python
users = {
    "aryan": {"email": "aryan@example.com", "password": "secure123"}
}

def reset_password(email, new_password):
    for username, data in users.items():
        if data["email"] == email:
            data["password"] = new_password
            return f"✅ Password reset successful for {username}!"
    return "❌ Email not found."

# Example
print(reset_password("aryan@example.com", "newpass123"))
print(reset_password("wrong@example.com", "tryagain"))
