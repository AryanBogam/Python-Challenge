# 🐍 Day 57/300 – Beginner Pattern Printing Problems  

Today, I explored **Python + Pattern Printing** — from simple rectangles and triangles to pyramids, diamonds, and checkerboard designs.  

It felt like learning the **core loop logic** behind **text-based visualizations, console UIs, and algorithmic design patterns**.  

This day was **beginner-level but logical** — these problems build the **foundations for more complex graphics, data visualization, and algorithm challenges**.

## 🔍 What I Solved Today  

1. **Simple Rectangle of Stars**  
   → Printed a rectangle using `*` for given rows and columns.  

2. **Right-Angled Triangle**  
   → Created a right-angled triangle pattern with `*`.  

3. **Inverted Right-Angled Triangle**  
   → Printed the reverse triangle pattern with `*`.  

4. **Number Triangle (1 to N)**  
   → Printed numbers in a triangular pattern.  

5. **Square of Numbers**  
   → Printed N×N square where rows contain repeated numbers.  

6. **Pyramid of Stars (Centered)**  
   → Printed a pyramid with proper spacing.  

7. **Inverted Pyramid of Stars**  
   → Printed the reverse of the pyramid pattern.  

8. **Floyd's Triangle**  
   → Printed continuous numbers in a triangular shape.  

9. **Checkerboard Pattern**  
   → Printed alternating `*` and `#` in a square pattern.  

10. **Diamond Pattern**  
    → Printed a diamond shape using `*`.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today’s challenge helped me **master loops and conditionals** through fun visual problems.  
From **triangles to diamonds**, I learned how **spacing, rows, and conditions** interact to form patterns.  

By solving these exercises, I realized how **simple loops power visual designs** that scale into **games, animations, and UI designs** later.  

Tomorrow? Moving toward **intermediate logic problems with real-world twists** to push my Python skills further.  
Because **“Small patterns build big logic.”**

## 🧠 Sample – Pyramid of Stars  

```python
def pyramid(rows):
    for i in range(rows):
        print(" " * (rows - i - 1) + "*" * (2 * i + 1))

pyramid(3)
# Output:
#   *  
#  ***  
# *****
