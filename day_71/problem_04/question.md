Q4. Friend Requests (Add/Remove Friends)

Build a system where:
A user can send a friend request to another.
The receiver can accept/reject it.
Store friendships in a dictionary or list (friends[username] = [list_of_friends]).
Handle duplicate requests, self-requests, etc.

This is the “social graph” — the real power of Facebook.
