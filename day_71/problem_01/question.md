Q1. User Registration System
Build a program where a new user can sign up with:

Username
Email
Password

Features:
Store users in a dictionary ({username: {email, password}}).
Check if username/email already exists.
If yes → show error, else → register successfully.

This is your foundation: no user system, no Facebook.
