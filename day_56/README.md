# 🐍 Day 56/300 – Google Maps: Intermediate Python Problems  

Today, I explored **Python + Google Maps logic** — from distance calculations and nearest location finders to route optimization and clustering points by proximity.  

It felt like simulating **real-world mapping and navigation systems**, showing how Python powers **location-based analytics, route planning, and basic geo-computations**.  

This day was **fun, intermediate-level, and practical** — these problems reflect the **foundations behind map-based apps, delivery systems, and geo-data analytics**.

## 🔍 What I Solved Today  

1. **Distance Between Two Points**  
   → Calculated straight-line distance using coordinates.  

2. **Find Nearest Location**  
   → Found closest point from a given list of locations.  

3. **Route Distance Calculator**  
   → Computed total distance across multiple stops.  

4. **Bounding Box Finder**  
   → Found smallest rectangle enclosing all given points.  

5. **Check If Point Lies Inside Area**  
   → Verified if a point falls inside a rectangular region.  

6. **Cluster Points by Proximity**  
   → Grouped points based on given distance threshold.  

7. **Find Farthest Location**  
   → Located the farthest point from a given location.  

8. **Simulate Map Zoom Levels**  
   → Created a simple zoom-based grid representation.  

9. **Midpoint Calculator**  
   → Computed midpoint between two locations.  

10. **Basic Route Optimizer**  
    → Simulated a greedy approach to optimize a travel route.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today’s challenge helped me **bridge Python logic with real-world mapping use-cases**.  
From **route optimization to clustering points**, these problems made me think like someone **building the backend of mapping and delivery systems**.  

By solving these exercises, I realized how **simple geometry + Python** can be scaled into **full-fledged map-based applications** using real APIs later.  

Tomorrow? Moving toward **data visualization + real APIs** to make these ideas come alive visually.  
Because **“Every big system starts with a simple script.”**

## 🧠 Sample – Distance Between Two Points  

```python
import math

def distance(p1, p2):
    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2
    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

print(distance((0,0), (3,4)))
# Output: 5.0
```
