Q10. Basic Route Optimizer (Mini Traveling Salesman)

Task: Given a start and multiple points, find a path with minimal distance (try greedy algorithm).
Input: Start = (0,0), Points = [(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)]
Output: Route = (0,0)->(1,1)->(2,2)->(3,3)
Why: Builds logic for real-world route optimization apps.
