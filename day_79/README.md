# 🐍 Day 79/300 – Student Grades Management System in Python 📚  

Today, I built a **Student Grades Management System** – a complete CRUD application to practice **dictionary operations**, **functions**, and **menu-driven programming** in Python.  
This project focused on **data storage, user interaction, and building a console application from scratch**.

## ✅ Features Implemented  

- 📝 **Add Students** → Store student names with their grades using dictionary.  
- ✏️ **Update Grades** → Modify existing student's grade with validation.  
- 🗑️ **Delete Students** → Remove students from the system safely.  
- 👀 **View All Students** → Display complete list with grades.  
- 🔄 **Interactive Menu** → Loop-based menu system for continuous operation.

## 💭 Daily Reflection  

Today was all about building a **complete application** with multiple features:  
- Learned how **dictionaries** are perfect for storing key-value data like student records.  
- Practiced **function organization** – breaking complex logic into manageable pieces.  
- Understood **user experience** – creating clear menus and helpful error messages.  
- This felt like building real software that could actually be used by someone!
