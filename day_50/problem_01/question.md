Q1. To-Do List Manager (Insert & Remove Tasks)

Task: Build a program to manage a to-do list where users can add tasks, remove completed ones, and show the current list.
Why: In real apps (Google Tasks, Notion), lists are the backbone of task managers.

tasks = ["Buy groceries", "Read book", "Workout"]

Add: "Finish Python project"
Remove: "Read book"
Final: ["Buy groceries", "Workout", "Finish Python project"]
