# 🧠 Day 24/300 – Mastering Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets in Python  

Today was about strengthening core Python logic through **hands-on practice with lists, dictionaries, and sets** — the foundation of every powerful backend or automation tool.

## ✅ Topics Practiced

- 🔁 Loops with lists, dictionaries, sets  
- 🧠 Nested data structures  
- 📊 Frequency analysis using `dict`  
- 🎯 Filtering with `set`  
- 🛠️ Real-world simulation challenges

## 🔍 What I Solved Today

1. **Product Inventory Tracker**  
   → Track stock value & find out-of-stock items using `dict + list`.

2. **Unique Visitor Counter**  
   → Count unique IPs and block duplicates using `set`.

3. **Student Grade Book**  
   → Manage students' marks, calculate averages & top scorer using `dict of lists`.

4. **Movie Watchlist Manager**  
   → Add/search/sort movies by rating & genre using `dict + list`.

5. **Word Frequency Analyzer**  
   → Count how often each word appears in a paragraph using `dict`.

6. **Online Poll System**  
   → Store votes, prevent double voting, and declare winner with `dict`.

7. **Library Book Borrow System**  
   → Track who borrowed how many books and find the top reader using `dict + list`.

8. **Email Duplicate Remover**  
   → Remove duplicate emails and print a clean list using `set`.

9. **Flight Seat Allocation System**  
   → Allocate seats, prevent double booking, and show available ones using `dict`.

10. **Restaurant Order Summary**  
   → Track total orders per table, calculate bill, and find top dish using `dict + list`.

## 💭 Daily Reflection

Repetition isn’t boring — **it’s how you master logic**.  
Every line of code today reinforced the idea that **simplicity scales** and **clean logic wins**.

Lessons:
- `dict` = organized speed  
- `set` = filter truth fast  
- `list` = ordered potential  
- Real-world logic > textbook theory
