# 🐍 Day 45/300 – Chrome Logic Systems in Python

Today, I built the **core logic behind Google Chrome-like features** — from counting tabs and managing bookmarks to filtering search suggestions and checking browser versions.

It felt like simulating **Chrome’s internal operations** in Python, breaking down how browsers handle tabs, history, themes, and security checks.

This day was **fun, lightweight, yet practical** — these are the same kinds of logical checks browsers perform constantly under the hood.

## 🔍 What I Solved Today

1. **Tab Counter**  
   → Calculated total tabs after opening new ones.

2. **Private Mode Detector**  
   → Checked if the browser is in incognito mode.

3. **Bookmark Checker**  
   → Verified if a website is bookmarked.

4. **History Cleaner**  
   → Cleared all browsing history.

5. **Download Progress Tracker**  
   → Simulated percentage-based download updates.

6. **Search Suggestion Filter**  
   → Displayed suggestions matching a given keyword.

7. **Ad Blocker Check**  
   → Blocked ads if a site is in the blocked domains list.

8. **Browser Theme Switcher**  
   → Switched between dark and light themes.

9. **Multiple Tab Closer**  
   → Removed specific tabs from the open tabs list.

10. **Chrome Version Validator**  
    → Checked if the browser version meets the minimum requirement.

## 💭 Daily Reflection

Today’s challenge gave me a **hands-on understanding of browser logic systems**.  
Chrome isn’t just a search bar — it’s **a set of precise rules and automated actions** behind the scenes.

By simulating these features in Python, I’m starting to think like a **browser developer**, focusing on **performance, accuracy, and user experience**.

Tomorrow? Stepping into **more interactive system simulations**.  
Because **“Small scripts can power big experiences.”**

## 🧠 Sample – Search Suggestion Filter

```python
def search_suggestions(suggestions, keyword):
    return [s for s in suggestions if s.startswith(keyword)]

# Example:
print(search_suggestions(["python tutorial", "python code", "java basics"], "python"))
# Output: ['python tutorial', 'python code']
