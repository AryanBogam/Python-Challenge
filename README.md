# 🐍 Python Daily Challenge

Welcome to my **Python Daily Challenge** – a disciplined journey of solving Python problems every day to sharpen my coding skills, strengthen problem-solving, and build consistency like a real-world developer.

## 🎯 Why This Challenge?

> "Stay asleep, follow the crowd, and wake up at 40 in regret. Or go all in now and build something so massive your parents forget they ever doubted you."

I chose this challenge to:
- Master Python by solving real-world logic problems
- Build a solid GitHub profile through daily commits
- Practice clean code, clear thinking, and consistent learning
- Prepare for AI, automation, and deep technical interviews
